### Technologies

One of the highlights of this project is that the user interface and database can be swapped with other frameworks/dbms by implementing the domain provided interfaces.

For this repo, we're using:
- Language: C++17
- Compiler: gcc
- Framework: Qt
- Database: SQLite
- Build system: CMake
- Profiling: gprof
- Libraries: STL
- Code coverage: gtest/gcov (to be applied soon)

Ubuntu linux environment is recommended, Qure is still untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Linux build.
